# pulse-demo

This project is a sample project that shows your spotify profile with your stats on your listening habits. You connect your Spotify account, and it gets your data to display it on the card. You can also share your card with others using a custom link. This project is a demo for Pulse.

I used Node.JS for the backend. Download the project files, open a terminal in the project folder, and run `npm install`. 

Create a `.env` file in the root folder. Use `.env.example` as a reference. You get your client keys from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
